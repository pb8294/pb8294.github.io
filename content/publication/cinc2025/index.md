abstract: 
  Ventricular tachycardia (VT) is a major cause of sudden cardiac deaths, treated with catheter ablation that targets and destroys the tissue responsible for initiating or sustaining VT. Pace-mapping is a key practice for identifying ablation targets by matching stimulated sites’ ECG to the observed clinical VT. An AI-assisted pace-mapping approach can help clinicians identify the most likely target sites, reducing procedure time and increasing the success rate.
