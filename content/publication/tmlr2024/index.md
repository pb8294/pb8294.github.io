abstract: 
  Deep active learning (DAL) studies the optimal selection of labeled data for training deep neural networks (DNNs). While data selection in traditional active learning is mostly optimized for given features, in DNN these features are learned and change with the learning process as well as the choices of DNN architectures. How is the optimal selection of data affected by this change is not well understood in DAL. To shed light on this question, we present the first systematic investigation on 1) the relative performance of representative modern DAL data selection strategies, as the architecture types and sizes change in the underlying DNN architecture (Focus 1), and 2) the effect of optimizing the DNN architecture of a DNN on DAL (Focus 2). The results suggest that the change in the DNN architecture significantly influences and outweighs the benefits of data selection in DAL. These results cautions the community in generalizing DAL findings obtained on specific architectures, while suggesting the importance to optimize the DNN architecture in order to maximize the effect of active data selection in DAL.
